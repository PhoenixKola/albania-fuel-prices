# Privacy Policy — Karburanti Sot

_Last updated: 2026-02-17_

Karburanti Sot (“the App”) displays public fuel price information and basic preferences you choose inside the App.

## What data we collect
**We do not ask for or collect personal information** such as your name, email address, phone number, contacts, photos, or precise location.

## Data stored on your device
The App stores the following **locally on your device** (on-device storage) to remember your preferences:
- Selected language (Albanian/English)
- Selected country

This preference data is not transmitted to us.

## Data the App fetches
The App fetches fuel price data from a **publicly available JSON source hosted online**. The App displays the data source inside the interface.

## Advertising
The App displays ads and uses third-party advertising SDKs (for example, Google Mobile Ads / AdMob).

These SDKs may automatically collect certain device and usage information in order to serve and measure ads. This may include:
- IP address (used for network communication)
- Approximate location inferred from IP (depending on the ad network’s settings)
- Ad performance and interaction data (e.g., impressions, clicks)
- Basic device information (such as device model, OS version)

We do not receive your Advertising ID directly, and we do not use it to identify you personally.

You can reset or limit ad personalization from your device settings:
- Android: **Settings → Privacy → Ads** (wording may vary by Android version)

## Analytics
The App does not use a separate in-app analytics product to track you (beyond what advertising SDKs may collect for ad measurement).

## Sharing
We do not sell your personal data.
However, **ad providers** may process certain data (described above) to provide advertising and measure performance.

## Security
The App does not use accounts or passwords. It downloads only public price data and stores only local preferences on your device.

## Children’s privacy
The App is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
